# integrable - plugin

This project follows a ** modular, layered architecture ** designed for internal tools and services – not for direct human interaction(CLI or UI), but for being used by other systems, such as APIs, schedulers, or workers.

The goal is clarity, testability, reuse, and separation of concerns.Each layer has a precise role, and the architecture is structured to allow safe refactoring, scaling, and debugging.

## 🧱 Layer Responsibilities

### `src / soap / `
   - Contains logic to build and send ** SOAP requests **.
- Returns raw XML with no filtering or transformation.
- This is the lowest level of interaction with external SOAP API.

### `src / services / `
   - Contains ** project - specific logic ** that is still reusable across useCases.
- Functions are as ** pure ** as possible(no side - effects, no I / O).
- Good place for transforming or filtering SOAP responses.

### `src / lib / `
   - Contains ** generic, reusable ** functions across projects.
- These are pure helpers(date parsing, formatting, string logic, etc).
- Nothing in here should depend on this specific project.

### `src / db / `
   - Contains ** Knex query builders ** for each table or SQL source.
- These builders do ** not execute ** the queries.
- This allows combining, modifying, and safely composing queries.

### `src / useCases / `
   - Each file implements a ** full, high - level use case**.
- These are the entrypoints for calling business logic.
- Designed to be called from outside(e.g., via an API or scheduler).
- A useCase can use`soap`, `services`, `db`, and`lib`.

## 🧪 Testing + CLI Prototyping

### `autoScenario.js`

This file allows you to ** run sequences of use cases manually **, without deploying or wiring up a full API.It serves as a ** manual test harness **.

You can run it using:

```bash
npm runByYourself
   ````

   * (This script should be added to your`package.json` as a custom npm command.)*

      This pattern is useful when you're prototyping or debugging workflows without relying on interactive input.

---

## 📦 Naming Conventions

   * Folder and filenames use ** camelCase ** or ** kebab -case**.
* Folder names are ** plural ** when they represent collections of utilities(`services`, `useCases`, `lib`), and ** singular ** when representing concepts(`soap`, `db`).

---

## 🧠 Key Principles

   * Each layer has a ** clear contract ** and minimal responsibilities.
* Side - effects are pushed to the edges(`useCases` and`soap`).
* Internals are designed to be ** testable **, ** composable **, and ** debuggable **.
* Promises are ** not auto - resolved ** at the `db` layer to allow flexibility.
* The architecture is designed for ** tools used by other tools ** (e.g., workers, schedulers, background services).

---

## 📘 Suggested Enhancements(Optional)

   * `types / `: For centralizing shared schemas or validation logic
      * `cache / `: If you implement local or in -memory caching strategies
         * `tests / `: For adding unit or integration tests with mocks

---

## 🏁 Summary

This architecture is ideal for building ** internal services **, ** background jobs **, or ** integrable plugins ** with clean boundaries between layers.You can use this as a base for other automation - oriented Node.js projects.

```

Let me know if you want me to generate the matching `package.json` with the`runByYourself` script and a basic`.gitignore`, or anything else to complete the template.
